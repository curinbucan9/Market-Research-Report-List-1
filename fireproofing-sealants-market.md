<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fireproofing Sealants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elastometric Type</li><li>Intumescent Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fireproofing sealants market is primarily categorized into two types: elastomeric and intumescent. Elastomeric sealants provide flexible, durable barriers that resist moisture and maintain performance under temperature fluctuations, making them ideal for expansion joints and perimeter fire stop applications. In contrast, intumescent sealants expand when exposed to high temperatures, forming a protective char layer that insulates and seals openings, preventing the spread of fire and smoke. Both types are essential for enhancing building safety and compliance with fire codes.</p></p>
