<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heated Windshield Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tungsten Wire Heated</li><li>Conductive Layer Heated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heated windshield market includes two primary types: tungsten wire heated and conductive layer heated windshields. Tungsten wire heated windshields utilize thin, nearly invisible tungsten wires embedded within the glass to generate heat, effectively defrosting and de-icing the surface. In contrast, conductive layer heated windshields employ a transparent conductive coating on the glass to distribute heat evenly across the surface. Both technologies enhance visibility and safety in cold weather conditions, catering to different consumer preferences and vehicle designs.</p></p>
