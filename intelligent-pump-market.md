<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intelligent Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pump</li><li>Positive Displacement Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Intelligent Pump Market encompasses two primary types: centrifugal pumps and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps utilize rotational energy to move fluids, making them ideal for high-flow applications with low viscosity liquids. In contrast, positive displacement pumps operate by trapping fixed volumes of fluid and forcing it through the discharge, providing precise flow rates and handling more viscous materials. Both types benefit from intelligent features, such as IoT connectivity and real-time monitoring, enhancing efficiency, maintenance, and operational control in various industries.</p></p>
