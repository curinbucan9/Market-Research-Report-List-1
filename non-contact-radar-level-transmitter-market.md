<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-Contact Radar Level Transmitter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Guided-Wave Radar Level Transmitter</li><li>Non-Contact Wave Radar Level Transmitter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Non-Contact Radar Level Transmitter market primarily includes two types: Guided-Wave Radar (GWR) and Non-Contact Wave Radar. Guided-Wave Radar transmitters utilize a probe to guide radar waves, providing accurate level measurements in various conditions, including turbulent or high-pressure environments. Non-Contact Wave Radar transmitters, on the other hand, emit radar waves from a distance, measuring the time it takes for the waves to return after reflecting off the surface. This method is ideal for applications with foaming or vapor interference.</p></p>
